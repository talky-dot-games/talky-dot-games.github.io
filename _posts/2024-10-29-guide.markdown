# File Structure #

### Making A Post ###
Posts are contained in the '\_posts' folder and new posts should be created there.
When creating a post the file must be named as follows: 'yyyy-mm-dd-postname.markdown' If you want it to be easier, just copy '2024-10-29-template.markdown' into the '\_posts' folder from the '\_secret' folder. 

### Post Info Config ###
At the top of '2024-10-29-template.markdown' are the post info parameters. They function as follows:
- layout: This should always be 'posts' otherwise the page won't display properly.
- title: The title of the post displayed on the 'posts' dropdown menu and the top of the post.
- postdate: The date the post was published. For consistancy's sake formatting should be Month DD, YYYY
- tags: Page tags help organize it around the site. Author tags are: Morgan - mkmn, Alex - bmbx, Preston - flra 
- author: The author credit displayed on the page. It can be any text
- permalink: The link to the blog page. To prevent permalinks getting confused please make the permalink the article title in all lowercase seperated-by-hyphens.

### Adding Images ###
Images are contained in the 'assets/posts' folder
When you create a blog that you want to have images in please create a new folder titled the same as the permalink. Your images go in there.
Image titles should be generally simple just so its easy to link to them.
A guide on adding images is later on.


# Formatting #
Pages are formatted with markdown. If you know how discord text formatting works, it's the same. There are a few custom changes tho.


- Create a single line break by adding \<br> after the line.

- Italicize text by surrounding it in asterisks \*Like This\*
- Bold text by surrounding it in double asterisks \*\*Like This\*\*

- Create headers by surrounding them in hashtags \#Like This\# 
- Single hashtags are the largest header 
- Double hashtags is the medium header 
- Triple hashtags are the smallest header

- Create image subtext by surrounding it in quad hashtags \#\#\#\#Like This\#\#\#\#
- Create spoiler text by surrounding it in quint hashtags \#\#\#\#\#Like This\#\#\#\#\#

- Add a link: \[Link Text in square brackets\](Link URL in parens)

If you ever want to use a symbol that is trying to do markdown stuff prefix it with \\ and it will display normally.

### Adding Images ###

Since markdown doesn't have native image support, you're gonna have to learn a lil bit of html (sorry)<br>
Just copy this code and change the defualt filepath to match the image you want. Be sure to include the \<br> in the copy if you want it to display correctly

**\<br>\<img src="/assets/posts/postImgFolder/imgname.png">\<br>**
